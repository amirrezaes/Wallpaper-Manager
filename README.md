# Wallpaper-Manager
changes wallpaper according to weather and time factors

you can add more pictures to *images* folder and associate them to a suitable category in *image_map.json*.

currently only weather and time optiones supported which will change wallpaper based on wather condition and day part (proxies and vpns might give wrong results).

**only has been tested on Windows10, mac and linux commands have been integrated but not tested**

**Todo:**
  
    1-always run in background and change wallpaper automatically
    2-allow hybrid option (so the snowing day would be diffrent from snowing night)
    3-test it on other OPs
    4-make code cleaner and get rid of some extra stuff
