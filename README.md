# Wallpaper-Manager
changes wallpaper according to weather and time factors

you can add more pictures to *images* folder and associate them to a suitable category in *image_map.json*.

currently only weather and time optiones supported which will change wallpaper based on wather condition and day part (proxies and vpns might give wrong results).

make sure you have geocoder library installed:

    pip install geocoder

**only has been tested on Windows10 and Ubuntu 20, mac command have been integrated but not tested**

**Todo:**
  
~~1-always run in background and change wallpaper automatically~~

    2-allow hybrid option (so the snowing day would be diffrent from snowing night)
    3-test it on Mac OS
    4-make code cleaner and get rid of some extra stuff
